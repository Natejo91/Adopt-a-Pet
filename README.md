# Welcome to Adopt-a-Pet!
*[Adopt-a-Pet](https://adopt-a-pet-app.herokuapp.com)* is a clone of the popular PetFinder website which connects users to animals from animal shelters all over the United States.




**Technologies: React, Redux, Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, CSS3, JavaScript**

**API's: Google Map API, PetFinder API, Dog API, Cat API**



After a span of 2 weeks, the goal was to have 3 fully functional MVP's:

- Animal Page  - This page details everthing about a specific animal as well as the information on the animal's shelter. A form to inquire about the animal will appear if you are                  logged in.
- Basic Search - Allow the user to search by animal type or by breed.
- Shelter Page - This page details a specific shelter displaying all the animals located at that shelter.


In addition to those 3 MVP's I was able to implement these bonus features:

- Favorite Page - A logged in user is able to favorite any animal they choose. Those animals are then displayed on the user's favorite animals page.
- Shelter Map   - Was able to implement Google Map API for the exact location of the animal shelters.  Implemented an InfoWindow as well to allow the user to click on the map to                     take you to the shelter page.
